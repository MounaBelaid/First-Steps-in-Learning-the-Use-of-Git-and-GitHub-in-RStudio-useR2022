Attendees include R developers and users who are data scientists, business intelligence specialists, analysts, statisticians from academia and industry, and students. The conferences showcase applications of R software and developments in the software itself, as well as new and updated R packages that provide boundless additional functionality to R. Community contributions form the foundation of useR! conferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nMouna Belaid is an engineer in Statistics and Data Analysis, graduated from the Higher School of Statistics and Data Analysis - ESSAI, Tunis and holds a research master’s degree in Data Processing and Complexity of Living Systems from National School of Engineers of Tunis - ENIT and Paris Descartes University.\r\nShe is currently a Business Intelligence Consultant at Prime Analytics in service for BNP Paribas Securities Services based in Paris, France.\r\nShe co-founders two communities: Tunis R User Group and PyLadies Tunis.
