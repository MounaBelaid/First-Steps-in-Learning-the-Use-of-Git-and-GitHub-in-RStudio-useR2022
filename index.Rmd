# Welcome

This is the course site for the _First Steps in Learning the Use of Git & GitHub in RStudio_ workshop created by Mouna Belaid for the [useR! 2022 Conference](https://user2022.r-project.org/about/user/).

Collaborating on code development and tracking changes in the code across versions are daily issues for big teams.
This session will equip you with the knowledge you need to make it easy to do so, as well as to contribute to various open source projects and to make your work more publicly accessible. This session will teach you how to institute best practices for using Git and GitHub in RStudio.

Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

This two-hour hands-on workshop will be a gentle introduction to learn about the benefits of using Git and GitHub and to dig into the best practices in coding and collaborating on GitHub.

# Audience

This workshop is designed for new R programmers, new GitHub users, users new to Git, students, managers. Besides, some programming knowledge with R will be helpful but is not required.

# About the useR! 2022 Conference

[useR!](https://user2022.r-project.org/) is an annual nonprofit conference organized by R community volunteers and supported by the R Foundation. Attendees include R developers and users who are data scientists, business intelligence specialists, analysts, statisticians from academia and industry, and students. The conferences showcase applications of R software and developments in the software itself, as well as new and updated R packages that provide [boundless](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) additional functionality to R. Community contributions form the foundation of useR! conferences.
